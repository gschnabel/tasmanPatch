This directory contains the input file `tasman.inp`
to initialize a TASMAN run and the also required
energy file `energies`.

Running TASMAN creates a lot of other files containing
the results of TALYS and in additional information 
specific to TASMAN.
If TASMAN is on the path, it can be started by

```
tasman < tasman.inp > tasman.out
```
